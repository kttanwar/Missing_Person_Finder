# Missing Person Finder
The project is a web based application where civilians can scan and upload data of any person who they believe are missing. 
The Face Recognition system will extract the face from those image scans and will save it with the data (eg Name, Age, current location etc) of the missing person.
The Face recognition system will display the uploaded data if the same face is uploaded by the family of the missing person providing them with some information for locating their family member.

The project is based upon the concepts of Face Recognition in Machine Learning. I used python as the programming language, OpenCV for Face Recognition, Haar Cascade for face detection while LBPH algorithm as face recognition algorithm. For the development of web application, I have used Flask and Jinja templating engine for backend and HTML, CSS, JS and BootStrap4 for frontend.
